LancasterStemmer is simple, but heavy stemming due to iterations and over-stemming may occur. Over-stemming causes the stems to be not linguistic, or they may have no meaning.

For example, in above code destabilized is stemmed to dest in LancasterStemmer whereas, 
using PorterStemmer destabl. 
LancasterStemmer produces an even shorter stem than porter because of iterations 
and over-stemming is occurred.
