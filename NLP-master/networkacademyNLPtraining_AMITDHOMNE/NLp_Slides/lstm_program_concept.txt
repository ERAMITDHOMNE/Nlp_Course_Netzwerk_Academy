We can divide the dataset of 2000 examples into batches of 500 then
it will take 4 iterations to complete 1 epoch.
Where Batch Size is 500 and Iterations is 4, for 1 complete epoch.


 1 epoch  = total Number of iteration to complete/ go through whole datset of network 
 Batch size  - 2000 row you in dataset but you are considering batch of data 500 in 1st iteration , next 500 (1000)in 2nd iteration and 
 in 3rd iteration next 500(1500), and next 500(2000) in 4th iteration from left to right
0 2000


500 you do iteration 
1000





multivariate vs univariate

Univariate  - when you are taking into considertion only one independent variable (input feature) and one out  variable (classification label/class)

For example  - Machine learning/NLP model to detect person is obesity / Normal


Input faeture - weight - 80 ,90,100, 200  (input feature )  - if weight > = 100 classify as obesity # one to one mapping                     
                                                              else classify normal 

  
VS 
  
Multivariate - when you are taking into considertion multiple independent variable (input feature) and one or more out variable variable (classification label/class)

weight - 80 ,90,100, 200  (2 input feature )  - if weight > = 100 and height > = 6 classify as obesity  
# many to one mapping                            else classify normal                      

Height - 4 ft , 5ft , 6ft , 7ft  

# output variable depand on binary classification # many to one mapping  or multiclassification ,# many to many ,#
