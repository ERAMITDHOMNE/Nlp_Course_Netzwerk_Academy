text - features - vector - array - how the vector data content or looks likes


RNN - Recurrent Neural Network # deep Learning  , # deep learning is the subset of machine learning , deep learning = 1 litre mug water / out machine learning 10 liter which neural network
LSTM - Long Short term Memory Algorithm   # deep Learning , Type of RNN algorithm

Diifference between algorithm discussed before and we are discussing today is :

HMM(Hidden Markov Model) - Memoryless # future event depand only current event # co

Naive Bayes = Memory less  #  we are not saving past information , you will not going to use information of month june to fing weather of 9th july but , you will used 8th july weather condition information to find 9 th july weather

RNN ,LSTM = Memory involve to network ,this network need to store information to find future event.For example eqaution = 2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+12+13  , 2 -> 3 , 1 - > 3 , 2+3+4+5+6, Example : -I am Engineer graduate form NIT Rourkela, # work on bidirection

I am Engineer graduate form NIT Rourkela = X  -> feature vector ->tokenization, stemming,lemmatization , imbalance dataset handling , used in RNN network , neural network, WX+b , from neuron and neuron in network


Appliction - > MACHINE TRANSLATION , language translation , context finding ,sentiment analysis , For example I am worried today - sad , worried, quite , for Hurray ! I won the match , snetiment  - Happy , enjoying, party mood , 




Amit given instruction to robot - . Hurray ! I am feeling very ______________ (HOT,COLD,BAD,HAPPY) -< Robot 



1. Hurray!

2 .Hurray! + I 

3. Hurray ! I a

4 Hurray ! I am feeling

5  Hurray ! I am feeling very ________ HOT/COLD/BAD/HAPPY

if query = refund in flipkart
   reply : already refunded 700 rs to your account
   
if  query : product exchange  # neural network node save data in memory
    reply : ok make request delivery person come at 9:00 am tomorrow to pick up exchange
