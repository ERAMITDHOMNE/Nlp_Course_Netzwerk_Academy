Spam - Lottery / asking for money , Dr .batra ,money  # keywords that helps  model to classify mail whether it is spam /ham

Ham - essential work ,   work on text data, class tomorrow, # Probabilty concept involves, keywords help to identify ham to any ,mail

 Bag of words  bigram = I am ,am NLP , [ 1 0] , [ 0 2] , ex  google query  ,LSTM ,RNN, Neural Network ,Naive Bayes
 
 p(H) = 1/2
 p(T) = 1/2
 
 Bag { 1 2 2 4 4 5}  1 = red , 2 = orange, 4= white , 5 = black  ,, incase atonce your are withdrawing P(orange) = 2/6
  p(orange) = 1 /6 = # first attempt , 
  p(orange) = 1 /5 = # Second attempt ,  # dependent event
  
  
  Independent feature / input feature  = X 
  predict = dependent / output feature = Y   spam / ham
  
  Independent {height ,weight ,body size ,waist size}= {obesity / thin}
               6 ,     70 , 36               obesity / thin
  Xi ,X2 ,X3                               = Y 
 
 
 X = 36 / 6 ,   , X = 4 ,5, 6   when neumerator is increasing X is increasing   ,,, X -> Neumerator
 
 X directly proportional to neumerator
 
 X = 24 /6      , x = 6 , 4. 8 ,4   , denominator increasing X is decreasing
 
 X inversely proportional to denominator
 
 Application spam / ham filtering : negative eamil spam { bank account ,deposite 10000$ , Maha lakshi lottery service , Dr batra}
